### 1. C++ Coding Style (Hard Rules)
Mandatory:
- Modernity: C++23 project. Prefer `ranges`, `views`, and `Niebloids`.
- Using: Use `using` or `__using` macro from `sak/using.hpp` (for multiple symbols) to avoid the scope operator `::`. No `using namespace`. ADL-sensitive STL utilities (e.g., `::std::move`, `::std::forward`) are exempt and MUST be qualified.
- Naming: Always `snake_case`. Class members prefixed with `m_`, template parameters with `t_`. Use descriptive and extensive names; abbreviations such as `i`, `w`, `h` are forbidden. STL, external libraries, and macros with numeric prefixes are exempt.
- Flow Control: No braces `{}` for single-line `if, for, while`.
- Allowed Comments: Only to explain subtle behaviors or in tests.
    - Must start with `//` followed by a TAB (`	`).
    - Written entirely in lowercase, without a trailing period. Each phrase on a new line.
- Operators: Use of `&&, ||, !, !=` operators is forbidden. Use of keywords: `and, or, not, not_eq`.
- Definitions: In `.cpp` files, single-statement methods must be on the same line as the signature (except constructors with initializer lists).
- Spacing: Internal spacing in `( )` and `[ ]`. E.g.: `if( condition )`, `array[ index ]`.
- Increment: Always prefer pre-increment (`++i`) and pre-decrement (`--i`).
- Indirection: Prefer `const&` (constant reference) to avoid `->` operator noise.
- Methods: Mark methods that do not change state with `const` and `noexcept`.
- Headers: Namespaces declared as `namespace n {` on the same line. No extra indentation for namespace content.
- Main Function: Only place where double braces are mandatory: `{{ ... }}`.

### 2. Semantic Elevation (Philosophy)
- Data over Machinery: Hide the "machinery" (pointers, manual loops) to let the "data" speak.
- Visual Serenity: Reduce visual noise. Code should be a statement of intent ("what"), not a CPU instruction manual ("how").
- With composition: If a logic can be named, it should be a utility in the `sak` library. Avoid ad-hoc lambdas; prefer composing named entities.

### 4. Workflow and Tools
- Automation (MCP): Always use `create_class` and `create_test`. The code generated by these tools is the Gold Standard.
- Mimicry: Observe the structure, the order of includes, and the comments generated by the templates and mimic them strictly. Do not change the automatic boilerplate.
- Tests: Always use `sak::ensure` instead of `cassert`.
- Verification: 
    1.  Use the `analyze` tool after changes to run static analysis (cppcheck) and apply automatic formatting fixes.
    2.  Use the `compile` tool for incremental building and linking.
    3.  LLMs frequently generate false positives regarding the spacing of `( )` and `[ ]`. Never trust your visual intuition. If you suspect a violation, verify using the `verify_formatting` MCP tool.

### 5. `sak` Library (Swiss Army Knife)
- Generic and domain-independent utilities (math, geometry, patterns).
- Must not contain business logic or hardware dependencies.

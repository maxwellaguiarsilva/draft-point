### 1. C++ Coding Style (Hard Rules)
- **Modernity:** C++23 project. Prefer `ranges`, `views`, and `Niebloids`.
- **Naming:** Always `snake_case`. Class members prefixed with `m_`.
- **Logical Operators:** Use of `&&, ||, !` is forbidden. Mandatory use of `and, or, not`.
- **Spacing:** Mandatory internal spacing in `( )` and `[ ]`. E.g.: `if( condition )`, `array[ index ]`.
- **Flow Control:** No braces `{}` for single-line `if, for, while`.
- **Increment:** Always prefer pre-increment (`++i`) and pre-decrement (`--i`).
- **Main Function:** Only place where double braces are mandatory: `{{ ... }}`.
- **Headers:** Namespaces declared as `namespace n {` on the same line. No extra indentation for namespace content.
- **Indirection:** Prefer `const&` (constant reference) to avoid `->` operator noise. Use `using` or `__using` macro from `sak/using.hpp` (for multiple symbols) to avoid the scope operator `::`. No `using namespace`.
- **Methods:** Mark methods that do not change state with `const` and `noexcept`.
- **Allowed Comments:** Only to explain subtle behaviors or in tests.
    - Must start with `//` followed by a **TAB** (`	`).
    - Written entirely in lowercase, without a trailing period. Each phrase on a new line.

### 2. Semantic Elevation (Philosophy)
- **Data over Machinery:** Hide the "machinery" (pointers, manual loops) to let the "data" speak.
- **Visual Serenity:** Reduce visual noise. Code should be a statement of intent ("what"), not a CPU instruction manual ("how").
- **With composition:** If a logic can be named, it should be a utility in the `sak` library. Avoid ad-hoc lambdas; prefer composing named entities.

### 4. Workflow and Tools
- **Automation (MCP):** Always use `create_class` and `create_test`. The code generated by these tools is the **Gold Standard**.
- **Mimicry:** Observe the structure, the order of includes, and the comments generated by the templates and mimic them strictly. Do not change the automatic boilerplate.
- **Tests:** Always use `sak::ensure` instead of `cassert`.
- **Verification:** 
    1.  Do not compile until requested. Use the `compile` tool for building.
    2.  Use the `check` (cppcheck) tool after changes and address all warnings.
    3.  **False Positives:** LLMs frequently generate false positives regarding the spacing of `( )` and `[ ]`. Never trust your visual intuition. If you suspect a violation, verify **strictly** using the `verify_spacing` MCP tool or `run_shell_command` (with `grep` or Python scripts) before reporting or changing the code.

### 5. `sak` Library (Swiss Army Knife)
- Generic and domain-independent utilities (math, geometry, patterns).
- Must not contain business logic or hardware dependencies.

# Coding Style Guidelines for C++ Project

This document outlines the coding style conventions to be followed for this project.
Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency and readability across the codebase.

## General Rules

##  **No Comments in Code Implementation:**
    *   Code should be self-documenting.
    *   Avoid adding comments within the code's implementation logic.
    *   License headers and file description comments at the top of a file are permitted.
##  **Naming Convention:**
    *   All identifiers (variables, functions, classes, namespaces, etc.) must use `snake_case`.
    *   `CamelCase`, `PascalCase`, `kebab-case`, or any other casing style is forbidden.
    *   Header guards must follow the `header_guard_<timestamp>` format and are automatically generated by the `create-class` script. They should not be manually created or modified by the programmer or the LLM assistant.
    *   **Example (Good):**
        ```cpp
        int my_variable;
        void process_data( );
        class my_class;
        ```
    *   **Example (Bad):**
        ```cpp
        int myVariable;
        void processData();
        class MyClass;
        ```
##  **Parentheses and Brackets Spacing:** Always include a single space immediately after an opening parenthesis `(` or square bracket `[` and immediately before a closing parenthesis `)` or square bracket `]`.
    *   **Example (Good):**
        ```cpp
        if( condition )
            do_something( );
        auto my_value = my_array[ index ];
        ```
    *   **Example (Bad):**
        ```cpp
        if(condition)
            doSomething();
        auto myValue = myArray[index];
        ```
##  **Single-Line Control Structures:**
    *   For `if`, `for`, and `while` statements that contain only a single line of code, omit the curly braces `{}`.
    *   Additionally, there should be no space between the keyword and the opening parenthesis.
    *   **Example (Good):**
        ```cpp
        if( condition )
            do_something( );
        for( init; condition; ++count )
            do_something_else( );
        while( condition )
            another_thing( );
        ```
    *   **Example (Bad):**
        ```cpp
        if (condition) {
            doSomething();
        }
        ```
##  **Increment/Decrement Operators:** Always prefer pre-increment (`++count`) over post-increment (`count++`) and pre-decrement (`--count`) over post-decrement (`--count`).
    *   **Example (Good):**
        ```cpp
        ++count;
        ```
    *   **Example (Bad):**
        ```cpp
        count++;
        ```
##  **`using` Clauses:**
    *   Use `using` clauses to avoid fully qualifying type names.
    *   **Example:**
        ```cpp
        using ::std::chrono::high_resolution_clock;
        // ...
        auto start_time = high_resolution_clock::now( );
        ```
    *   **Scope:**
        *   In header files (`.h++`), `using` clauses must always be placed within the smallest possible scope (e.g., inside a function, class, or namespace), never at the global file scope. An exception is made for `using ::std::string;`, which is permitted at the global file scope in header files.
        *   In implementation files (`.c++`), `using` clauses may be placed at the global file scope.


##  Validation.
*   After producing any code in C++, perform a final validation to ensure each of the previous items has been strictly followed.
    *   If any of them are not in compliance with this document, use the available tools to make the necessary adjustments.
*   Do not consider the code to have been properly delivered until this validation is 100% okay.

##  Validation with cppcheck.
*   After completing the previous validation, perform a new validation using the "cppcheck" tool.
    *   If any part of the code is not in compliance with this document, use the available tools to make the necessary adjustments.

# Project Check Workflow

This document outlines the procedure for performing a comprehensive evaluation of the project to ensure its integrity and quality.

## Procedure

1.  **Do Not Modify Files:**
    Under no circumstances should any files be modified during this check.

2.  **Complete Project Evaluation:**
    Perform a thorough assessment of the project to verify that no details have been overlooked.

3.  **Respect Intentional Issues:**
    Some errors or bugs may be accompanied by comments in the code explicitly stating they should be ignored. In such cases, they must be disregarded.

4.  **Ignore Unused Assets:**
    Do not include unused classes or files in the evaluation.

5.  **Starting Point:**
    Begin the evaluation process from the `source/main.cpp` file.
